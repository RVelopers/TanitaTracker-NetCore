# TanitaTraker-NetCore
This is a dotnet core web application to work alone with the Omron Body Composition Monitor and Scale (HBF-514C) that allows you to register user, add multiple body scan to each individual user and create reports based those data points.

# Convention 
We are going to follow the [**Feature Branch**](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) to fix issues and implement all new features. The default branch is set to `develop` and each weekend we are going to merge changes to the `master` branch. **DO NOT CREATE PR TO BRANCH MASTER (it will be declined)**
